## Helm Chart and Dockerfile for Samba4 based on alpine:latest.

This Chart is fully-featured and enables some neat features :

 * Shares `persistentVolume`s, `hostPath`s, `flexVolume`s and arbritrary volumes that might not even have k8s drivers yet via samba/cifs
 * Creates users based on values provided or doesn't
 * Works with it's own automated build docker image or with the #1 hit for samba on dockerhub (even though that has no autobuild, has only ever been built once and only has a :latest tag.  You've been warned!)

## Users

The chart will provision you smb users automatically based on the `samba.users` values.  This is the recommended way of dealing with users using this chart.  example `values.yaml` settings for the `samba.users` block :

```YaML
samba:
  users:
  - username: myuser
    password: hunter2
  - username: myotheruser
    password: CorrectBatteryHorseStaple
```
Setting these values via a secrets management system is recommended.

## Storage

Most of this chart's cleverness is around the volume selection.  If you set `persistence.enabled` to true, it then looks at the value of `persistence.type` and acts accordingly.  The data volume is mounted in the container under `/data`.

| `persistence.type` | Description | Behaviour |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| `pvc` | Use an existing or new PVC for data | If `persistence.pvc.existingClaim` is set, then the chart uses that.  If not, it creates a PVC based on `persistence.pvc.size` (default 8Gi), `persistence.pvc.accessMode` (default ReadWriteOnce), and `persistence.pvc.storageClass` (default blank, default class for your cluster) |
| `hostPath` | Use a `hostPath` type mount | Suitable for single-machine clusters or setups that have a host-based shared filesystem (e.g. nfs).  Looks at `persistence.pvc.hostPath` to create the mount. _*NOTE*_: using this you must also set `privatePersistence` up with a different path or different class of persistence or your smb passwords will be accessible via smb! |
| `flexVolume` | Use a `flexVolume` driver to provide persistence | If you are using an out-of-tree persistent data plugin, you will want this.  It will set a flexVolume mount using what yaml you provide in `persistence.flexVolume` directly |
| `other` | Use something unexpected | As with the `flexVolume` option, this simply allows you to put raw yaml in `persistence.other` and it will be used directly.  This obviously is very powerful but can leave you with very broken deployment objects. |

### `privatePersistence`

This image optionally uses a second mount for samba's "private" storage (`/var/lib/samba` and `/etc/passwd`) so users can be persisted between pod restarts.  If you wish to manage your users manually and allow them to change their own passwords for instance you may set `privatePersistence.enabled` to `true`

If you don't specify any other `privatePersistence` options, the chart does it's best to do something appropriate.  If you want to set options, it's exactly the same as the above `persistent` storage.

These are the rules it uses -

 * if you use hostPath for your main storage, the privatePersistence is mounted as `.smbprivate/` underneath it.
 * if you use `persistence.type.pvc` without setting `privatepersistence.pvc.size`, it uses a default of `20Mi` for private data
 * if you use `persistence.pvc.existingClaim` and not `privatePersistence.pvc.existingClaim`, the chart will attempt to use defaults for the pvc that it creates.
 * if you use `flexVolume` or `other` for the `persistence` type and don't set a `privatePersistence` block of the same type, the chart will simply fail

## `smb.conf`

The container's `smb.conf` is loaded in via a configmap and is templated for some basic settings (single share).

Much like the `samba.users` config above, you can create `samba.global.extraLines` and `samba.share.extraLines` and add extra entries for the lines you wish to add.  For example your `values.yaml` may contain something like this (don't use that setting btw unless you know exactly what you're doing!):

```
samba:
  global:
    workgroup: HOMEGROUP
    extraLines:
    - key: fake oplocks
      value: yes
    - key: fstype
      value: Samba 
  share:
    nameOverride: bigdisk
    extraLines:
    - key: force user
      value: martyn
    - key: valid users
      value: martyn
```

## Why?
Because why not?  The use cases are actually multiple:
 * Home/LAB setup with windows clients
 * Kubernetes actually allows you to use volumes of type cifs, this might be a useful way of sharing a PVC in an environment where you have no `ReadWriteMany` cloudprovider
 * A lot of backup applications have SMB as a target, having SMB storage in your cluster so you only ever have to back up your PVCs is quite nice.
